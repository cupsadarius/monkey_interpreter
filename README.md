# Writing An Interpreter

---

## Introduction

This project is an interpreter for the [Monkey](https://interpreterbook.com/index.html#the-monkey-programming-language) programming language,
featuring its own lexer, AST producing parser and evaluator. The Monkey programming language as well as the structure of the interpreter 
are based on the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). 


## Monkey Language Features

A list of language features can be found [here](https://interpreterbook.com/index.html#the-monkey-programming-language).

You should be able to try them all out in the REPL.
